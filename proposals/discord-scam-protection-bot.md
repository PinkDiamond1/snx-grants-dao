## Title of proposal: 
A bot to report known scammers and detect users trying to impersonate core team, guardians, etc...

## Description: 
There is a constant effort to protect discord members from getting scammed by impersonators.
Its possible to react to new joiners or users changing their names and report if an impersonation get detected.

Community member DKOB has offered resources where he keeps track of all banned spammers accross 500 discord channels.
Those scammers bounce arround and many will try to join synthetix discord. We can recognize them and report when they join.

## Motivation: 
The bot would react to events related to user joining or renaming and either push a message to report an impersonation or delete the user automatically if that is the approach chosen.
The bot will report if a know scammer joins based on the feed from 500 discord channels and their banned users.
## Additional information: 
1. The bot will react  to guildMemberAdd event and check if the name ressembles that of a predefined list of protected names, or the name is in the list of known scammers
2. The bot will react  to guildMemberUpdate event and check if the name ressembles that of a predefined list of protected names, or the name is in the list of known scammers
3. If an impersonation is detected, a message is pushed to the channel "scam-protection" and guardins get a change to delete this user
4. Alternately, the user can be deleted programatically
